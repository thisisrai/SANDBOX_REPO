### Stretch

Pick a _different_ programming language from JavaScript (e.g. Ruby, Swift, Python, C, Java...) and write tests & implementations for each.

- [ ] Can run all non-JavaScript tests with a single command.
- [ ] For each algorithm identified above, there is a test file with multiple unit tests for each algorithm  _in a language other than JavaScript_.
- [ ] For each algorithm identified above, there is an implementation file with a correct implementation of the algorithm _in a language other than JavaScript_.
